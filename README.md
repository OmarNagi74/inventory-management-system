Inventory Management System 🏬

Inventory Management System is a desktop application built using JavaFX, Java, and MySQL, featuring full authentication and role-based access control.
The system is designed to streamline inventory operations, order management, and reporting for businesses.

💡 Project Idea

The system allows multiple types of users with specific roles and permissions to manage and interact with the inventory efficiently:

Admin: Full control over user accounts (view all users, edit roles, delete accounts).

Customer: Browse products, add items to the cart, place orders, and track order statuses.

Employee: View inventory, manage order statuses (in progress or delivered).

Manager: Manage inventory (add, remove, edit products), order from suppliers, track profits (monthly/yearly), and print reports.

This system ensures secure authentication, proper access control, and seamless inventory management.
